# Financial Analysis
This is a series of ipython notebooks for analyzing finance using Python's powerful <a href="http://pandas.pydata.org/" target=_blank>PANDAS</a> (Python Data Analysis) library. 

Also note that we are using the <a href="http://ipython.org/notebook.html" target=_blank>iPython notebook interactive computing framework</a> for running the code in this repository.

Gregory Saxton, thanks a lot for your examples in <a href="https://github.com/gdsaxton/Financial-Analysis-using-Python" target=_blank>Financial-Analysis-using-Python</a>.

I hope you find these scripts helpful.

Happy coding!
